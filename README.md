**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
•	The goal of this project was to read a list of food items from a text file and have the capability to search for a specific item and return a numeric value based upon the frequency of that string in the list as well as the name of the item, as well as return a list of items and a numerical number based upon the frequency and a histogram function that allowed a list of all items and the character * to be returned based upon frequencies as well.
**What did you do particularly well?**
•	Overall, the functions of this project were appropriate and functionable, I made some changes to the menu display to allow for better readability. And will likely make changes to follow more OOP guidelines.
**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
•	As I mentioned above following some OOP principles would enhance my code and allow for better readability and future updates, having my functions separated from my main class in a separate file would allow for easier readability and changes. Creating a menu function would also help my programs readability.
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
•	The most challenging for me was learning how to properly use the mapping feature. Although it didn’t take long to learn I used resources such as zybooks and GeeksforGeeks to gain a better understanding of how to use this C++ feature. Seeing additional examples and templates allowed me to quickly gain a better understanding than zybooks alone did.
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
•	Basic OOP principles would be transferable to most if not all other projects or course work, the use of functions will also transfer to future work to allow better readability and future updates.
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
•	The use of functions and inline comments make this program readable and adaptable. The inline comments allow another developer to quickly learn what each function is used for. If I had separated my functions into a separate file this would have made the program even more maintainable and readable.
